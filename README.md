# ‚≠êÔ∏è Installation

### Requirements

* `kubefwd` or any environments provided `port-forward`
* a `Kubernetes` Cluster.(minikube, EKS, ...)
* Some configurations in `values.yaml`
  * AWS Credentials for AWS SecretManager in `backend.services.secret.awsSecretManagerConnector`

### Commands

> ‚ö†Ô∏è  `inventory-scheduler` and `statistics-scheduler` doesn't work fine until you execute `initialize-spaceone` which is a Kubernetes `Job`. Please create the `Job` after reading the following commands. Those pods like `inventory-scheduler` or `statistics-scheduler` has some labels like `helm.stargate.spaceone.dev/need_initialization!=true`

You should input your aws credentials which have permissions for AWS Secret Mananger in `values.yaml`

```
$ helm repo add spaceone https://helm.stargate.spaceone.dev
$ helm repo update
$ helm install sp spaceone/spaceone -f values.yaml
$ kubectl get pod -n sp -l "helm.stargate.spaceone.dev/need_initialization!=true"

$ sudo kubefwd svc -n default # this command can be replaced with any codes to execute the same job.
```

üëΩ After every pod except for `inventory-scheduler` and `statistics-scheduler` gets ready, you should create a Kubernetes `Job` named `initialize-spaceone` to initialize data. You can see the manifest for the `Job` by the following commands.
```
helm get notes sp
# OR replace sp with your release name.
```

You can see the console page via http://console-client

## Usage examples

### 1. Deploy the whole SpaceONE service with this chart.

What you should do is only to input your aws credentials in `values.yaml`

        awsSecretAccessKey: PLEASE_INPUT_YOUR_AWS_CREDENTIALS
        regionName: PLEASE_INPUT_YOUR_AWS_CREDENTIALS
```

### 2. Deploy this chart with your own SpaceONE micro services.

```
# values.yaml
# Supposing that you run identity service on your local environment.
...
backend:
  services:
    identity:
      enabled: false
      endpoint: PLEASE_INPUT_YOUR_HOST:YOUR_PORT
```

### 3. Deploy this chart with your own Databases
